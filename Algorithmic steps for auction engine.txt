4. Eliminate the ones that don't have overlap rental times, keep the ones which overlap
5. Run the second price auction selector, select the highest bid with its actual price as high_price and price of (second highest bid+0.01) as second_price

6. Select all offers which have offer time as part of the rental time of the selected bid. 
7. Eliminate all of the ones more expensive than the high_price
8. Match it with the most expensive one that comes under high_price for price of offer
9. If the most expensive one comes under the second_price, match it for second_price
