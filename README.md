## A-Bare-Metal-Marketplace Project Description

### Context: 
- Many hosts do not use cloud servers due to multiple constraints including security, privacy, or a need for specific hardware. Hosts often rent space in a data center for their servers.

### Bare-Metal Marketplace: 
- In order to allow for scalability or temporarily increased resources and the opposite- productive use of unnecessary resources, a marketplace to buy and sell time on bare-metal nodes where a renter can use nodes for any purpose. 

### Project Goal: 
- Implementing an auction system in order to facilitate the fair economics of the bare-metal marketplace system.

### Reach Goals:
- Adding a system for filtering based on resource 
- Autobuy systems for HPC and temporary scaling purposes based on various criteria including cost per resource
- An enhanced UI

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

The vision of this project is an Openstack service for data centers to implement an auction system for already written Bare Metal Marketplace technology in order to facilitate the trade of computing resources among DC clients. This has applications primarially in industry and in research contexts.

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

This section describes the principal user roles of the project together with the key characteristics of these roles. This information will inform the design and the user scenarios. A complete set of roles helps in ensuring that high-level requirements can be identified in the product backlog.

Again, the description should be specific enough that you can determine whether user A, performing action B, is a member of the set of users the project is designed for.

## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:

The Scope places a boundary around the solution by detailing the range of features and functions of the project. This section helps to clarify the solution scope and can explicitly state what will not be delivered as well.

It should be specific enough that you can determine that e.g. feature A is in-scope, while feature B is out-of-scope.

## 4. Solution Concept

This section provides a high-level outline of the solution.

Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:

This section provides a high-level architecture or a conceptual diagram showing the scope of the solution. If wireframes or visuals have already been done, this section could also be used to show how the intended solution will look. This section also provides a walkthrough explanation of the architectural structure.

 

Design Implications and Discussion:

This section discusses the implications and reasons of the design decisions made during the global architecture design.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

This section discusses the minimum acceptance criteria at the end of the project and stretch goals.

## 6.  Release Planning:

Release planning section describes how the project will deliver incremental sets of features and functions in a series of releases to completion. Identification of user stories associated with iterations that will ease/guide sprint planning sessions is encouraged. Higher level details for the first iteration is expected.

## General comments

Remember that you can always add features at the end of the semester, but you can't go back in time and gain back time you spent on features that you couldn't complete.
